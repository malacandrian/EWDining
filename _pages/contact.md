If you want to talk to us, we'd love to hear from you. Whether you've tried one of our recipes, have a suggestion for something we can do, or just want to say hello. Here's how you can do that.

1. **Comments**

    There's a comment section at the bottom of every post. We try to keep an eye on all the discussions, and weigh in where we see fit. This is a great place to join in, just make sure you read the [community guidelines](/community) first.

2. **Social Media**

    You can find us on various social media sites. Our official accounts are listed in the subscriptions panel on the right (or below if you're on mobile). Personal accounts can be found on the [about us](/about-us) page.

3. **Email**

    If you'd rather something more direct or private, you can try sending us an email. We all read anything sent to [ews@williams.ee](mailto:ews@williams.ee). If you want to message one of us directly, you can find our personal email addresses on the [about us](/about-us) page.
