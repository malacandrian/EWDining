We think your privacy is great, and want to look after it. Here's how we do that.

## Personally identifiable information

The only identifiable information we collect is email addresses for our mailing list. The only way we get these is when you choose to give them to us. If you ever change your mind, send an unsubscribe request and we'll remove it from the list immediately. We currently use [Zoho campaigns](https://www.zoho.com/campaigns/) for managing our mailing list, and trust them to keep your details secure. If we ever learn that they have mismanaged your data we will let you know, and move your details to a more secure company.

## Anonymised tracking

To help improve our website and the content we deliver we use [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) on this website. This does not allow us to see any specific information about any one viewer, but shows us general trends about how people tend to use the site and what kinds of content they prefer.

If you do not wish to be tracked like this, you can [opt out of Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin).

## Third parties

The site relies on third party products that may track or collect data. These are outside of our control, and we cannot be certain exactly what information they collect, but we have listed it here to the best of our knowledge.

### Disqus

Our comments section is powered by [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). In order for you to log in and comment, they need to set cookies on your computer. They may also perform tracking for their own purposed.

### Youtube

All our videos run on Youtube. Youtube tracks which videos you view so they can suggest other videos, and to target advertising at you.

### Advertising

In the future we may choose to run adverts. In this case the ad network, as well as individual advertisers may be able to track you and set cookies.
