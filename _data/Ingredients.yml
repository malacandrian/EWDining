      item: Goats' Milk
      proportion: Replace the milk 1:1.
      comment: Goat's milk has a slight flavour to it, and a lower fat content than cows' milk. Goat's milk still contains some lactose, so may not be appropriate for all lactose intolerant people.

        - Lactose

      item: Soy Milk
      proportion: Replace the milk 1:1.
      comment: This is probably the most common, and easiest to find milk substitute. The exact flavour and consistency varies between brands, so some experimentation will be necessary. Soy has a stronger flavour than other milk substitutes, so may not be suitable for more deilcate dishes.

      item: Rice Milk
      proportion: Replace the milk 1:1.
      comment: Many claim rice milk has the most similar flavour to cow's milk. It is slightly sweeter, so consider reducing the amount of sugar or other sweeteners (e.g. honey/syrup) in the recipe.
